    ```
    *food.html*
    ```
    <form action = "{{ url_for('addfood') }}" method = "POST">
      <h3>Food Info</h3>
      Name<br>
      <input type = "text" name = "name" /></br>
      Calories<br>
      <textarea name = "calories" ></textarea><br>
      Cuisine<br>
      <input type = "text" name = "cuisine" /><br>
      Vegetarian<br>
      <input type = "text" name = "is_vegetarian" /><br>
      Gluten Free<br>
      <input type = "text" name = "is_gluten_free" /><br>
      <input type = "submit" value = "submit" /><br>
	</form>
    ```
    
    *result.html*
    ```
    <h1>result of addition : {{ message }}</h1>
	<h2><a href = "/">Home</a></h2>
    ```

3. Initialize your database.  Create a file called `initdb.py`.  Copy the contents shown below into `initdb.py`.  Run `initdb.py` with this command: `Python initdb.py`.  After running this script a file called `database.db` is created.  This is your `SQLite3` database.  `SQLite3` reads and writes to a single static file without needing a separate database server running locally.

	*initdb.py*
    ```
    import sqlite3

    connection = sqlite3.connect('database.db')
    print ('Opened database successfully')

    connection.execute('CREATE TABLE foods (name TEXT, calories TEXT, cuisine TEXT, is_vegetarian TEXT, is_gluten_free TEXT)')
    print ('Table created successfully')
    
    connection.close()
	```

4. Create your server file, import the needed dependencies, and create the home route (`/`).  This route should render the `home.html` template.  Start your server and go to `localhost:5000/`. Your file structure should now look like this:
    ```
       project-name/
       --server.py (or whatever you named your python script)
       --initdb.py
       --database.db
       --templates/
       ---- home.html
       ---- food.html
       ---- result.html
       --venv/
    ```
    
5. Implement the `/enternew` route.  This route should simply render `food.html`.


6. Implement the `/addfood` route.  This route should accept a `POST` request.  This route should accept the form data sent from the `food.html` template and `INSERT` it into the database.  Use the lecture code as a reference.  Verify that you are correctly inserting the data into the database by uploading your `database.db` file to http://inloop.github.io/sqlite-viewer/.

### Extra Credit

1. Create a route called `/favorite` that queries the database for your favorite food and returns it as `JSON`.  Hard code the query string, it doesn't need to be dynamically built from a route parameter.  For example, `'SELECT * FROM foods WHERE name = "mango"'`.  Make sure this food already exists inside of your database.  Add a link to this route on your home page.

2. Create a route called `/search`.  Add the search form below to your `home.html` file below the food database header.  `/search` should accept a `GET` request and then access the query parameter `name` and use that to perform a `SELECT` query on the database for any row that has a matching `name` field.  Return the results as `JSON`.

	```
    <form action="{{ url_for('search') }}" method="GET">
        <h3>Search</h3>
        <input type="text" name="name" />
        <input type="submit" />
    </form>
	```

3. Create a route called `/drop`.  This route should drop the table `foods`.  Return the string `'dropped'` after successfully dropping the table.  This wipes out the `foods` table so all of your routes will be nonfunctional until you run the `initdb.py` script again.
